# Building Image Generation Using GauGANS

GauGAN uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic images that are conditioned on cue images and segmentation maps

The main components of a GauGAN are:
SPADE (aka spatially-adaptive normalization) 
Variational encoder
Multi-scale patch discriminator
